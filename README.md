# QML-RGB-Sorter
Modern C++ and QML UI to load and sort rgb images into colour groupings.

This is a project to show how QML can be used to control back end code with limited knowledge (registered objects and enums) of the back end whilst providing a simple UX.

# High level goals
- QML UI for easy interactions
- Threaded sorts
- Sort images (an interesting problem, given the many ways to organise pixel colours)
- User selectable sorts and metrics for the sort
